2 Valuation
Sections 154 to 161L of the Customs Act 1901 give the
legal rules for arriving at the valuation of imported goods.
These provisions are aimed at assessing the total amount
paid for the goods, packed and in export condition, at
their place of export.
The place of export is where the goods were posted,
containerised, loaded onto a ship or aircraft or crossed
an international border after they were otherwise loaded.
The valuation date is the ‘date of export’ from the place
of export.
2.1 Transaction value
In most cases the import sales transaction is the primary
valuation method. In plain English, for most importers the
import sales transaction is what you paid for the goods.
Customs and Border Protection can require you to show
evidence of what you paid. This is the price actually
paid or payable when the goods are sold for export to
Australia.
While some adjustments are permitted to this price, the
most common adjustment is the conversion to Australian
currency. This conversion is made based on the valuation
date (see above). In most cases, the Customs value
(AUD) is the converted transaction value.
2.2 Other valuation methods
There are six valuation methods in the Customs Act
1901. Apart from the Transaction Value method (above)
the other methods are Identical Goods, Similar Goods,
Deductive, Computed and Fall-back. Refer to the
Customs Act 1901 for how each method may be applied.

3.7 Charges – Customs and
Border Protection, DAFF
Biosecurity and POST
The Import Processing Charges Act 2001 sets out cost
recovery charges that are payable depending on the type
of communications you may make with Customs and
Border Protection, DAFF Biosecurity and Australia POST.
These are government-regulated charges that attempt
to fairly recover the cost of facilitating the import process
and protecting the community from potential risks.
In introducing cost recovery, Customs and Border
Protection ensures that costs recovered are clearly
aligned with the cost of processing an import transaction.
The charges are reviewed annually and remain tied to
the cost of delivering Customs and Border Protection
functions.
These costs are also available in Australian Customs
Notice 2005/36 (Cost Recovery under CMR) on the
Customs and Border Protection website.
DAFF Biosecurity charge fees on import declarations and
other services. Refer to their website at
<www.daff.gov.au> for further information.

4 Rights and obligations
You have rights and obligations when importing goods
into Australia. Customs law2 details your rights and
obligations. You must be aware of Customs law and
regulations and incorporate your understanding of them
when making an import declaration or when providing
additional information to Customs and Border Protection.
Ignorance of Australian laws is not an excuse for
providing incorrect information. If you are in any doubt
about any of the information Customs and Border
Protection requires please contact the Customs
Information and Support Centre (CI&SC) on 1300
363 263 or a Customs broker before submitting your
declaration form.
You have the right to ask Customs and Border Protection
about the progress of your importation. You also have the
right to know why we require certain information and to
which government entities we will pass that information.
Whenever possible Customs and Border Protection will
tell you the status of your goods, what action is pending
by Customs and Border Protection in relation to your
importation and what you can do to help the process.
Customs and Border Protection has published service
standards for its dealings with clients and you have
the right to know what they are. Those standards are
described in the Client Service Charter available from
Customs and Border Protection counters or on the
Customs and Border Protection website.
Customs and Border Protection have an obligation to tell
you the reasons why specific service standards relating to
your importation were not met, if that is the case.

8 Assistance with completing
an import declaration
If you have difficulties in completing an import declaration,
Customs and Border Protection officers can provide

you or complete a declaration on your behalf.
The use of a Customs broker is recommended for
someone who is new to the process of importing.
Please note that there is a fee for services provided by a
Customs broker.
Brokers specialise in the clearance of imported goods
and are licensed by Customs and Border Protection.
They may be found on the Customs and Border
Protection website, internet or the local telephone
directories.
For assistance, phone the Customs Information and
Support Centre (CI&SC) on 1300 363 263.
