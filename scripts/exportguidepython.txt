1. Introduction
During a declared outage contingency Export Declarations will only be accepted and
processed by Customs and Border Protection for cargo due to be delivered to cargo
or container terminals during the next 24 hours. Industry Clients are responsible for
prioritising the submission of these documents.
This document contains two components. The first is a Quick Guide which clients
should refer to in the first instance and outlines the process required to complete a
contingency transaction in electronic form.
The second component is a Detailed Guide which provides guidance on how to:
• download and save contingency files from the Customs and Border Protection
website;
• complete mandatory and optional fields for the transaction type;
• correctly name the contingency file: and
• submit completed contingency transactions to Customs and Border Protection
for processing.
Electronic communication is the preferred option by Industry and Customs and
Border Protection for communicating contingency data. This method is effective, user
friendly, and provides a quick turnaround of cargo status.
Where contingency transactions cannot be submitted via electronic means, clients
may use Hardcopy (paper) forms.
Please note: In accordance with Section 126E of the Customs Act 1901,
recovery reports must be submitted to the Integrated Cargo System
(ICS) within 24 hours of the CEO of Customs causing notice to be given
that the system has become operative.

2. Electronic Export Declaration (EDN) Quick Guide
(cid:190) Download the “Contingency Export Declaration” file (refer to Section 3.2
for further information on downloading a contingency file).
(cid:190) Enter the data in the required fields (refer to Section 3.3 for further
detail).
Note that multiple entries can be made on the same CSV export
declaration file where those exports are being delivered to the same
establishment – that is, the same “Port of Loading”.
When completing a multiple line contingency Export Declaration it
is critical that the senders reference is the same for each line
otherwise each line will be treated as a separate
document (separate EDN).
(cid:190) Save the file with a Naming Convention (refer to Section 3.4 for further
information)
(cid:190) Attach the file to an email.
(cid:190) The subject line for the email should be ‘Contingency Export
Declaration’
(cid:190) Address the email to ICSBCP@customs.gov.au and send to Customs
and Border Protection (refer to Section 3.5 for further information on
how to submit a contingency file)
Customs and Border Protection will process the file and provide one of the following
status results:
Contingency All cargo with a contingency number allocated can be presented for
Number export. For multi-line declarations a contingency number will be
documented against each line. The contingency number will be in a
similar format to the following: 1M07CEDN3560.
‘1M’ – is the state and port code;
‘07’ - is the year;
‘CEDN’ - is for contingency EDN;
‘3560’ - a consecutive serial number, generated by the BCP.
Held Cargo with “Held” status may not be exported and is to be held
pending secondary actions by Customs and Border Protection or
AQIS. The reporting party will be contacted by Customs and Border
Protection, where necessary, to process the “Held” status. When
secondary actions have been completed by Customs and Border
Protection and the cargo is cleared for export, Customs and Border
Protection will alter the “Held” status by allocating a contingency
number on the contingency file and will re-send to the reporting party.
Permit Cargo with permit required status may not be exported. The
Required reporting party is to obtain a permit, update the contingency data and
re-submit to Customs and Border Protection. The same sender’s
reference number is to be quoted as in the original submission.

titled ICS Business Continuity. The ICS business continuity screen will
display as per the following screenshot.
Home>Integrated Cargo System>ICS Business Continuity (BCP)
ics business continuity
ICS Business Continuity Plan
In the event of an ICS outage, ICS slow response times, ICS specific issues, and/or client system problems it is
critical that industry be able to continue normal daily business with minimal disruption through alternate cargo
reporting procedures. A contingency period can be either when an ICS outage occurs or a client’s cargo system
outage occurs.
Customs and Border Protection, in partnership with Industry and AQIS has developed an Integrated Cargo System
(ICS) Business Continuity Plan (BCP).
ICS Business Continuity Plan
For general information on the ICS BCP, including who to contact to find out more, refer to
Australian Customs Cargo Advice 2006, Number 27.
What do I do in an outage?
Depending on the urgency of the cargo clearance you can decide whether to lodge a contingency file or wait for the
ICS problem to be resolved.
Note: All contingency files submitted to Customs and Border Protection MUST be submitted in the ICS within 24hrs
of it becoming operational.
Refer to the following folders for detailed procedures to follow when submitting transactions for clearing cargo during
a contingency period. These folders also contain the electronic contingency file
IMPORT - ICS Import Business Continuity Folders
EXPORT - ICS Export Business Continuity Folders
Contacts
All contingency files should be emailed to the BCP Mailbox.
Email: ICSBCP@customs.gov.au
All other BCP queries or issues should be directed to the Customs Information and Support Centre (CI & SC).
Email: cargosupport@customs.gov.au
Phone: 1300 558 099

2/. Click on Export – ICS Export Business Continuity Folders Under the
heading Export Declaration (EDN) there is a help guide and a link to
the contingency file.
Version 1.0 BCP EDN 8

3.2 Downloading the Contingency File
The following steps outline how a client should download and save a contingency file.
Note: This document provides a guide for users utilising Microsoft Internet Explorer
as their web browser. The process may differ slightly for users utilising other
applications.
1/. Click on the Contingency Export Declaration (EDN) file. The File
Download dialogue box displays.
2/. Select Save
3/. The Save As screen will appear.
Select a folder location where you want to save the contingency file on
your computer by using the drop down arrow next to the “Save in” field.
Before you Save ensure that the file is saved in Comma Separated
Value format (.csv). The field should automatically populate as a .csv
file.
The saved file will negate the need to download from the web source for
any subsequent contingency reports.
Version 1.0 BCP EDN 9

If you create and save multiple reports in the same minute (i.e. At 12:35 pm for
example) you will be able to give the files separately referenced names according to
the naming convention e.g. EDN41000495269194647660.csv (refer to Section 3.4 for
further information) and save them in the same folder, or shared folder. Quoting the
time is not a set requirement as indicated in earlier help guides.
4/. Click on Save.
5/. Locate the contingency file and open it. The following screen will
display. (Note: example is using MSExcel).
6/. Select the box in the corner of the spreadsheet as shown below and highlight the
cells in the spreadsheet
Version 1.0 BCP EDN 10

7/. Right-click your mouse and select format cells. Select Text and click OK
8/. Now the cells are formatted as text, enter the data into each of the fields as required
(refer to Section 3.3).
9/. After the data has been entered, Save the changes according to the file naming
conventions (refer to Section 3.4).
Note. The following prompt will appear when saving a spreadsheet in .csv format
using Microsoft Excel:
Select Yes
After the spreadsheet has been saved in .csv format, closing the file will result in
another prompt to save the file again as follows:
This does not mean the first “save” was unsuccessful. This is a design feature of
Excel allowing the user to save the file in a different format if required.
Select No.
Version 1.0 BCP EDN 11

3.3 Completing the Contingency File
3.3.1. Critical Points for completing Microsoft excel spreadsheets saved
in comma separated value format (.csv).
All contingency files used for the Customs and Border Protection BCP are Microsoft
excel spreadsheets saved in comma separated value format (.csv). Please
ensure you do not add any formatting to the spreadsheets prior to forwarding
them to Customs and Border Protection. This will ultimately result in the data
being corrupted and the file will not be processed.
• File completion;
o Fill in each mandatory field.
o Repeat information across each line if a multiple line file, ie each
mandatory field is fully completed down the column and across the row,
“no dittos”.
o Save as an excel .csv file, in text format.
3.3.2 Filling in the Export Declaration (EDN) contingency file
The following procedure outlines how a client should complete an Export Declaration
contingency file.
Note. An Export Declaration file should not contain any more than 1000 lines.
1/. Locate the contingency Export Declaration (EDN) file from the
Export - ICS Export Business Continuity Folders on the ICS
Business Continuity page or open the file from the location it is saved
as per steps in Section 3.2. The file will open as an excel spreadsheet.
2/. Select the cell underneath each field to complete, using the tab button or
arrow to navigate between fields. Do not leave blank rows or empty
mandatory cells.
3/. Complete all fields according to the table below. Note: To assist in the
compilation of the spreadsheet the MANDATORY fields are indicated by
the column headers in CAPITALS and conditional or optional fields are
in lower case.

Multiple Line Export Declaration Report File
A single contingency export declaration report file can be used to report multiple
export declarations. Each row in the spreadsheet can be used to report a separate
export declaration.
When completing a multiple line contingency export declaration it is critical that the
senders reference is the same for each line if the line relates to a single declaration
otherwise each line will be treated as a separate document (separate EDN).
Status will be applied to each separate line in the multiple line report. When one line
of a declaration is applied a “held” status then ALL lines in the report for that
declaration will be “held” and the goods cannot be presented for export.
Where all lines are applied with a contingency number then the same contingency
number will be applied to all lines providing the senders reference is the same on
each line.
Where lines quote a different senders reference, a different contingency number will
be applied.
Version 1.0 BCP EDN 17

3.4 Naming the Contingency File (File Naming Convention -
EDN)
The BCP database will accept various alpha/numeric characters in the name as long
as:
1. The prefix for Export Declarations (EDNs) is EDN
2. The spreadsheet file is saved as a comma separated value (.csv) file in TEXT
format.
3. The number of alpha/numeric characters in the reference can vary between 0
and 70
4. There are no spaces or wildcard characters in the name, e.g.
• EDN41000495269194647660.csv,
Reporting Party ID and Time are only suggested references. You can include any
reference or number between the prefix and file extension.
File naming structure with mandatory sections in bold.

Version 1.0 BCP EDN 18

4. Hardcopy (paper) Contingency Forms - Export Declaration
(EDN)
Hardcopy (paper) contingency data will continue to be accepted but it is noted that
the success of the BCP is reliant on electronic communication of contingency data.
Hardcopy forms can only be lodged in person at Customs counters – refer
Attachment A of the ICS Business Continuity Plan for locations of Customs counters
in the regions. Faxed and mailed contingency data will not be accepted.
Contingency hardcopy (paper) transactions can generally be lodged at Customs
counters between the hours of 0900 to 1700 (local port time) – Monday to Friday
Prior to using Hardcopy (paper) forms clients must seek permission from Customs
and Border Protection (via the Customs Information and Support Centre – 1300 558
099) who will then make arrangements for clients to present these contingency
transactions at a Customs and Border Protection counter. For more information
please refer to Section 42 the ICS BCP.
Contingency export declaration (B325)
To be completed and lodged by exporters or customs brokers in replacement of an ICS electronic export
declaration. Contingency export declarations will only be accepted and processed by Customs for cargo
due to be delivered to cargo or container terminals during the next 24 hours.
Hardcopy contingency data processing only applies to the following reports
• Export Declaration
• Certificate of Clearance
• Export Sub Manifest.
• Impending Arrival
• Actual Arrival
• Underbond movement/transhipment
• Import Declaration
Please Note: Contingency Cargo Reports are not permitted as a hard copy process.
