Documentary Import Declaration Comprehensive Guide 11.1 Who should use this guide
This Guide will assist importers who wish to clear goods
imported by sea, air or international mail (post) from Customs and Border Protection by submitting an import declaration by document.
Goods with a value above A$1000
All goods imported into Australia by sea, air or post with a value that exceeds the import entry threshold of A$1000 must be cleared by submitting a completed import declaration form (B650) and paying duty, goods and services tax (GST) and other taxes and charges that apply.
Information regarding importations by international
mail (post) is available from the Customs and Border Protection website at <www.customs.gov.au/site/page5653.asp>. You can only use the Import Declaration – Post (N10) form for goods imported by post.
GST deferral and Australian Business Number (ABN)
If you or your organisation is registered for GST deferral you must lodge import declarations electronically.
Client registration
You must register as a client in Customs and Border Protection’s Integrated Cargo System (ICS) to lodge import declarations by document. In most cases you will need to register your supplier as well using the same form. There are different requirements that apply when making an Import Declaration – Post (N10). The client registration form is available at: <www.cargosupport.gov.au/webdata/resources/files/B319.pdf>
Self Assessed Clearance (SAC) declarations for low value goods
Goods with a value under the low value goods threshold of A$1000 (except goods that arrive by post) are cleared from Customs and Border Protection by submitting a SAC declaration. In most cases your Freight Forwarder or express courier will make a SAC declaration on your behalf. In some cases you may need to engage a SAC declaration service provider or a Customs broker to make a SAC declaration on your behalf on a fee for service basis. For further information see the fact sheet, Self-assessed Clearance (SAC) Declarations, available at: <www.customs.gov.au/site/page5302.asp>.Communicating electronically with Customs and Border Protection
For further information about communicating electronically with Customs and Border Protection and purchasing a digital certificate, email cargosupport@customs.gov.au or phone Customs Information and Support Centre on1300 363 263.
Who must make an import declaration?
The owner of imported goods is required to make an import declaration. According to Customs law, an owner of imported goods may be the importer, someone who holds themselves out to be the owner, someone who has a beneficial interest in the goods or someone who has control of the goods. In this guide the term owner is used in that context.
Who can act on your behalf?
Customs brokers
You may choose to have a Customs broker deal with
Customs and Border Protection on your behalf. Brokers provide their services on a fee for service basis and can be located through the internet, the Customs and Border Protection website at <www.customs.gov.au> or in local telephone directories.
Employees
Any of your employees may act on your behalf to
make import declarations provided they are not also an employee of another entity.
1.2 About this Guide
The Documentary Import Declaration Guide is provided as a guide to assist those who are required to complete and lodge import declarations. The Guide is designed for use by individuals or companies unfamiliar with Customs and Border Protection processes, industry terminology and legislative requirements.
The Guide discusses the Customs laws, regulations
and processes to be taken into account when declaring goods imported into Australia that have a Customs value exceeding the import entry threshold of A$1000. It explains what information an owner must provide when making an import declaration to Customs and Border Protection and provides a range of resources from both Customs and Border Protection and industry, along with links to helpful internet pages.1 Introduction

2 Documentary Import Declaration Comprehensive GuideThe Guide shows all the information fields that may
need to be answered on an import declaration (Form B650). The information that is required varies and may be dependent upon the nature of the goods; the end use of the goods; the country of origin; if concessions apply and a range of other factors.
The Guide provides details of the types of information
Customs and Border Protection expects to receive for each particular field. While the document is comprehensive, it does not cover every possible scenario.
If you are unsure of any aspect of making an import
declaration you should contact the Customs Information and Support Centre (CI&SC) on 1300 363 263 or consider using the services of a Customs broker.
Please note: It is an offence to provide false and/
or misleading information to Customs and Border Protection.
1.3 About import declarations
Goods imported into Australia are subject to Customs control until released into home consumption or otherwise treated. Import declarations are used to clear goods with a value that exceeds the import entry threshold of A$1000
1 from Customs control.
Customs and Border Protection require import declarations to be lodged into the ICS. To lodge an import declaration, you may:
• use the services of a licensed Customs broker who
will complete the Customs and Border Protection requirements for you based on the information you provide
• complete an import declaration and present it at a Customs and Border Protection counter, or
• communicate with Customs and Border Protection electronically via the ICS. A digital certificate is required.Before Customs and Border Protection clear your goods for delivery you (the owner) or your agent may be required to submit an import declaration at a Customs and Border Protection counter. Whoever submits the declaration will be required to:
• present a correct and completed import declaration
• provide Evidence of Identity (EOI) of the owner
• provide a Customs Client Identifier (CCID)/Australian
Business Number (ABN)
• register as a Client in the ICS using Form B319 (if not already registered)
• provide invoices, bills of lading, air waybills and commercial documents if requested to do so
• provide permits, licences and/or approvals if required to do so
• answer any additional questions if required to do so
• pay duty taxes and charges as required.
The Form B650 is available from all Customs and Border Protection client service counters or can be downloaded from www.customs.gov.au/webdata/resources/files/b650.pdf. A copy of the form is also included as an attachment to this document beginning at page 57.
Customs and Border Protection conducts EOI checks
to verify the identity of the parties with which it deals. Clients who submit documentary import declarations will need to undergo an EOI check each time they present import declaration documents to Customs and Border Protection for manual processing (this check will be made on the person presenting the documents). EOI documents are required when an import document is faxed.
If you lodge a Postal Import Declaration, EOI will
only need to be provided when Customs and Border Protection requests it.
EOI will not be required by Customs and Border
Protection if you utilise the service of a Customs broker
however the broker will have their own requirements for
identity verification.
For further information on which documents are accepted
for EOI please see: <www.customs.gov.au/webdata/resources/files/FS_EOI_DocumentaryDecs.pdf>
1 Section 68 of the Customs Act 1901 (the Act) outlines the requirements for the formal entry (via the ICS) of goods.

Documentary Import Declaration Comprehensive Guide 31.4 Client registration
To register as a client you must complete a Client
Registration Form (Form B319) and submit it to Customs and Border Protection. If you already have a Customs Client Identification (CCID) or an ABN you are not required to register again.
Registration by document
If you have an ABN or ABN/CAC (Client Activity Centre) that number is your unique identifier once your information has been entered into the ICS.
If you do not have an ABN you will be allocated a
unique identifying number known as a CCID. When communicating information to Customs and Border Protection you will need to use your registered ABN, ABN/CAC or your CCID.
Clients are responsible for the accuracy of information
they supply to Customs and Border Protection. It is important they ensure the correctness of the information before it is communicated.
1.5 Offences
It is important that the information given to Customs and Border Protection is true and correct. The Customs Act 1901 contains a range of offence provisions and many are ‘strict liability’ offences.
More information about offences and the Infringement
Notice Scheme is available on the Customs and Border Protection website. It is an offence to make false declarations to Customs and Border Protection.
1.6 Service Standards for manually lodged declarations
If you lodge a declaration by document, it is entered by Customs and Border Protection into the ICS on your behalf.
After receipt of a complete and accurate declaration, we
aim to advise by close of business of the next working day on whether:
• the goods can be cleared• further information is required, or
• a Customs and Border Protection examination is
required.
Regular audit checks are undertaken to ensure accuracy of import declarations against the commercial documents and the physical cargo.
Commercial documents relating to the goods must be
retained and available for inspection for at least five years. Penalties apply where instances of non-compliance with Customs and Border Protection requirements are detected.
The service standard of Postal Import Declarations is
five (5) working days from the receipt of completed documents. To access the client service charter information go to: <http://www.customs.gov.au/webdata/resources/files/ClientServiceCharterDL-WEB.pdf>.
1.7 Payments
A ‘payment’ is the settlement by an importer, or their representative, of liabilities to Customs and Border Protection or other Commonwealth government agencies (such as the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry (DAFF) Biosecurity) for duties, taxes and charges on imported goods before goods can be released for home consumption.
A payment may be made:• over the internet by either credit card or Eftpos, or
• over the counter at a Customs and Border Protection
office. In this case the payment options vary and include cash, cheque, credit card or Eftpos where available.
All methods of payment are not available in all circumstances, check with the Customs Information and Support Centre (CI&SC) on 1300 363 263 for clarification.

4 Documentary Import Declaration Comprehensive GuideSections 154 to 161L of the Customs Act 1901 give the
legal rules for arriving at the valuation of imported goods. These provisions are aimed at assessing the total amount paid for the goods, packed and in export condition, at their place of export.
The place of export is where the goods were posted,
containerised, loaded onto a ship or aircraft or crossed an international border after they were otherwise loaded.
The valuation date is the ‘date of export’ from the place
of export.
2.1 Transaction value
In most cases the import sales transaction is the primary valuation method. In plain English, for most importers the import sales transaction is what you paid for the goods.
Customs and Border Protection can require you to show
evidence of what you paid. This is the price actually paid or payable when the goods are sold for export to Australia.
While some adjustments are permitted to this price, the
most common adjustment is the conversion to Australian currency. This conversion is made based on the valuation date (see above). In most cases, the Customs value (AUD) is the converted transaction value.
2.2 Other valuation methods
There are six valuation methods in the Customs Act 1901. Apart from the Transaction Value method (above) the other methods are Identical Goods, Similar Goods, Deductive, Computed and Fall-back. Refer to the Customs Act 1901 for how each method may be applied.2 Valuation

Documentary Import Declaration Comprehensive Guide 53.1 Customs and Border
Protection calculations
You do not need to make any calculations regarding duty and GST liabilities. The ICS will make all the correct calculations based upon the information you have supplied. When your declaration is processed Customs and Border Protection will provide you with an Outstanding Payment Advice showing all amounts payable to Customs and Border Protection relating to your imported goods. The information provided below is for explanation purposes only.
3.2 Duty payable
Duty rates payable are determined by the tariff classification for your goods. The Customs Tariff Act 1995
(known as The Tariff) provides the tariff classifications, duty rates, interpretive rules and information on preference schemes, other concessions and exemptions that may apply to your goods. The Tariff is available at Customs and Border Protection counters or on the Customs and Border Protection website. Duty is payable on the Customs value of the goods (see examples in 3.6).
3.3 GST payable
GST applies to most imported goods, with a few exemptions. The main exemptions are for certain foodstuffs, some medical aids and imports that qualify for certain duty concessions. GST is applied at 10 per cent of the VoTI. Additional information is available from the Australian Taxation Office, Customs and Border Protection counters or on the Customs and Border Protection website (see examples in 3.6).
Note: For imported goods the value of the taxable
importation (VoTI) is the sum of:
• the customs value (CV)
• any duty payable
• the amount paid or payable to transport the goods
to Australia and to insure the goods for that transport (T&I), and
• any Wine Equalisation Tax (WET) payable.3.4 Wine equalisation tax (WET)
WET applies to the following alcoholic beverages:
• grape wine, including sparkling wine and fortified wine
• grape wine products such as marsala, vermouth, wine
cocktails and creams
• other fruit wines and vegetable wines, including fortified fruit wines and vegetable wines
• cider (from apples) and perry (from pears), and
• mead and sake, including fortified mead.
WET for imported wine is calculated as:
• 29 per cent of the purchase price at inwards duty free
OR for other importations:
• 29 per cent of Customs value + Duty + International
Transport and Insurance (see examples in 3.7)
3.5 Luxury car tax (LCT)
LCT applies to motor vehicles (except motor cycles or similar road vehicles) with a Luxury Car value that exceeds the LCT threshold of A$57,466 (for the 2011-2012 financial year) that:
• are designed to carry a load of less than two tonnes
and fewer than nine passengers, and
• have a Luxury Car value above the threshold.
The LCT rate is 33 per cent, which commenced 1 July 2008, prior to that the rate was 25 per cent.
LCT does not apply to fuel efficient cars below the fuel
efficient luxury car threshold of A$75,375 (for the 2011-2012 financial year).
The definition of a road vehicle for LCT purposes includes
limousines regardless of the passenger carrying capacity. The value above which the LCT becomes payable is the LCT threshold. It is important to note that under current ATO legislation, the LCT threshold is re-evaluated annually and subject to change.3 Calculations

6 Documentary Import Declaration Comprehensive GuideWhile the LCT threshold is GST-inclusive, LCT is only
payable on the GST- exclusive amount which exceeds the fuel efficient luxury car threshold.
The LCT rate of 33 per cent however, remains applicable
where a fuel efficient luxury car exceeds the fuel efficient luxury car threshold. The LCT value is calculated as the sum of the VoTI (see examples in 3.6).3.6 Calculation examples

Documentary Import Declaration Comprehensive Guide 73.7 Charges – Customs and
Border Protection, DAFF Biosecurity and POST
The Import Processing Charges Act 2001 sets out cost recovery charges that are payable depending on the type of communications you may make with Customs and Border Protection, DAFF Biosecurity and Australia POST.
These are government-regulated charges that attempt
to fairly recover the cost of facilitating the import process and protecting the community from potential risks.
In introducing cost recovery, Customs and Border
Protection ensures that costs recovered are clearly aligned with the cost of processing an import transaction. The charges are reviewed annually and remain tied to the cost of delivering Customs and Border Protection functions.
These costs are also available in Australian Customs
Notice 2005/36 (Cost Recovery under CMR) on the Customs and Border Protection website.
DAFF Biosecurity charge fees on import declarations and
other services. Refer to their website at
<www.daff.gov.au> for further information.

8 Documentary Import Declaration Comprehensive GuideYou have rights and obligations when importing goods
into Australia. Customs law2 details your rights and
obligations. You must be aware of Customs law and regulations and incorporate your understanding of them when making an import declaration or when providing additional information to Customs and Border Protection.
Ignorance of Australian laws is not an excuse for
providing incorrect information. If you are in any doubt about any of the information Customs and Border Protection requires please contact the Customs Information and Support Centre (CI&SC) on 1300 363 263 or a Customs broker before submitting your declaration form.
You have the right to ask Customs and Border Protection
about the progress of your importation. You also have the right to know why we require certain information and to which government entities we will pass that information.
Whenever possible Customs and Border Protection will
tell you the status of your goods, what action is pending by Customs and Border Protection in relation to your importation and what you can do to help the process.
Customs and Border Protection has published service
standards for its dealings with clients and you have the right to know what they are. Those standards are described in the Client Service Charter available from Customs and Border Protection counters or on the Customs and Border Protection website.
Customs and Border Protection have an obligation to tell
you the reasons why specific service standards relating to your importation were not met, if that is the case. 4 Rights and obligations
2 Customs Act 1901, Customs Regulations 1926, Customs (Prohibited Imports) Regulations 1956,

Documentary Import Declaration Comprehensive Guide 9Certain types of goods are prohibited from being
imported into Australia. These goods are listed in Schedule 1 of the Customs (Prohibited Imports) Regulations 1956.
For further information on prohibited imports go to:
http://www.customs.gov.au/site/page4369.asp
Other types of goods are restricted from being imported
unless certain conditions are met
3. You will need to obtain
a permit, licence or letter of authority from the proper Government agency to be able to import prohibited or restricted goods
4.
That permit, licence or authority must be available to be presented to Customs and Border Protection before you are allowed to receive the goods.
Attempting to import prohibited or restricted items
without prior approval is illegal. Such illegally imported goods will be seized and you may face penalties and/or
prosecution.
Your goods will not receive Customs and Border
Protection clearance unless you are able to show the original permit at a Customs and Border Protection counter if requested to do so.
In some cases copies of permits are acceptable. Often,
the release of the goods is conditional on a permit being produced to Customs and Border Protection as required under Customs law or Customs-related law. 5.1 Customs and Border Protection examination of goods
Customs and Border Protection may need to examine goods that are imported into Australia to verify the goods are as described, and to ensure the goods are not prohibited or restricted or a quarantine risk.
This may require examination by X-ray or other equipment
or a physical examination of the goods. Customs and Border Protection may advise you or your agent of the intention to physically examine the goods and permit you or your agent to attend the examination.
Customs and Border Protection can open, examine,
take samples from and perform tests on the goods as necessary to verify the nature of the goods or their characteristics.5 Prohibitions and restrictions
3 These goods are listed in the Customs (Prohibited Imports) Regulations 1956
4  For further information about how to obtain approval for a restricted import refer to the “Prohibited and Restricted Imports” page at  www.customs.gov.au

10 Documentary Import Declaration Comprehensive Guide6.1 Why was my parcel
stopped by Customs and Border Protection?
All goods imported into Australia are subject to Customs and Quarantine controls. Your parcel may be held by Customs and Border Protection and/or DAFF Biosecurity for any of the following reasons:
• a permit or approval is required
• evidence of value is required
• more information about the goods is required
• an import declaration is required
• a payment is required for duty, GST and other taxes
and charges
• a DAFF Biosecurity examination or treatment is required.
6.2 My goods are for my private or personal use, so why does Customs and Border Protection not send them on?
The law requires that all goods – whether secondhand or new, commercial or private – are subject to the assessment for Customs duties, Goods and Services Tax (GST) and other taxes and checked for community protection risks.
When goods with a value that exceeds A$1000 are
imported, the importer may be required to pay duty, GST and other taxes and charges. The goods must also be declared to Customs and Border Protection using an import declaration.6.3 My goods were sent as a gift, so why should I pay anything at all?
There is no longer a concession for goods that are sent as a gift. The ‘gift concession’ (by-law number 9740019) was revoked on and from 1 October 2008.
Goods that are gifted, donated, loaned or supplied free of
charge are still subject to assessment for duty and other taxes and charges if they have a value over A$1000 or if the goods are tobacco and/or alcohol products. Where there is no evidence of the value of the goods available the legislation provides other ways of determining value. 6 Frequently asked questions

Documentary Import Declaration Comprehensive Guide 11The import/export industry has many participants who
each play a vital role in international commerce. Not all of these industry types are well-known. A brief description of the major roles these participants play is provided below.
7.1 Agents
Agents are parties who act on behalf of another party when dealing with Customs and Border Protection. There are special requirements about who can act as an agent to make an import declaration on your behalf.
7.2 Airlines
Airlines lodge arrival reports and air cargo reports either as the owner of the aircraft or as an agent for other airlines. They may also lodge import declarations and sub-manifests for their own cargo or act as agents for their clients if they are also Customs brokers. Some airlines may also act as a Cargo Terminal Operator (CTO).
7.3 Cargo Terminal Operators
A Cargo Terminal Operator (CTO) is an organisation operating at a place appointed under section 77G of the Customs Act 1901 to load and unload cargo and is a Depot. CTOs are permitted to move goods under Customs control with permission to approved places. CTOs may release cargo directly into home consumption or for movement to a section 79 Warehouse or another section 77G Depot when approved.7.4 Consolidators/Deconsolidators (Depots)
Consolidators are persons or organisations that pack together groups of two or more consignments into one consignment. Deconsolidators are persons or organisations that unpack consolidated cargo for distribution to two or more consignees.
7.5 Customs brokers
Customs brokers are trained professionals in Customs business. They have undertaken formal training and must be a licensed member of their industry group. Customs brokers can provide a full range of services for you and may act on your behalf when you are importing or exporting goods. Brokers often are affiliated with Freight Forwarders.
Customs brokers can be found on the Customs and
Border Protection website, the internet or the local telephone directories.
7.6 Depots
Depots are facilities licensed under section 77G of the Customs Act 1901, at which cargo is stored prior to the release from Customs control. These Depots may also undertake deconsolidation of cargo.7 Industry participants

12 Documentary Import Declaration Comprehensive Guide7.7 Freight Forwarders
A Freight Forwarder’s main business is getting clients’
cargo to their door. A Freight Forwarder is an enterprise engaged in the consolidation and movement of freight often by a combination of transport modes.
Freight Forwarders can be found on the internet or local
telephone directories.
7.8 Permit Issuing Agencies
Permit Issuing Agencies (Government agencies) are responsible for granting permission for certain goods to be imported or exported. Permissions may be granted subject to conditions. Those agencies also receive regular downloads of data or reports from Customs and Border Protection information systems regarding imports and exports of goods regulated by them.
7.9 Shipping companies
Shipping companies lodge arrival reports and sea cargo reports either as a principal agent for a ship or as a slot charterer. They may also lodge import declarations and sub-manifests for their own cargo or acting as agents for their clients if they are also Customs brokers. Shipping companies generally move cargo over sea routes between international ports.7.10 Slot Charterer

Documentary Import Declaration Comprehensive Guide 13If you have difficulties in completing an import declaration,
Customs and Border Protection officers can provide some limited assistance but cannot make decisions for you or complete a declaration on your behalf.
The use of a Customs broker is recommended for
someone who is new to the process of importing. Please note that there is a fee for services provided by a Customs broker.
Brokers specialise in the clearance of imported goods
and are licensed by Customs and Border Protection. They may be found on the Customs and Border Protection website, internet or the local telephone directories.
For assistance, phone the Customs Information and
Support Centre (CI&SC) on 1300 363 263.
This section of the Guide shows you how to complete
each field on the documentary import declaration (Form B650).
Each field is numbered, with a matching explanation
of what is required. The layout of the Guide follows the three sections of the form: Section A Header, Section B Transport Details and Section C Tariff Details.
Please complete the form in black ink and use block
letters throughout. The form is included as an attachment to this document in 12.1.8 Assistance with completing an import declaration

you must notify Customs and Border Protection without delay. Customs and Border Protection will provide you with a new import declaration form.
Record your correct information in the necessary fields
and present it to a Customs and Border Protection counter.
If you fail to make amendments for errors and/or
omissions and Customs and Border Protection finds such errors or omissions on your declaration form, you could be held liable for making a false or misleading statement to Customs and Border Protection and penalties may be applied.Amendments can be made under the following circumstances:
• Prior to lodgement – Nil Effect

amount of duty, taxes and/or charges than was paid will mean a new outstanding payment advice will be issued to you.
Withdrawal of the import declaration can also be  made prior to the goods being delivered using  Import/Warehouse Declaration Withdrawal Form B371.

Documentary Import Declaration Comprehensive Guide 31When you have filled in all the necessary fields on the
import declaration you can present it to a Customs and Border Protection counter.
A Customs and Border Protection officer will enter the
information you have provided into the ICS. Errors may be flagged at this time and you will need to correct them by amending your form. Once the officer has entered your correct information into the ICS, the officer will submit the declaration.
Depending upon the information you have supplied, you
may be asked, in the form of lodgement questions, to provide additional information. These questions seek additional responses from you regarding community protection, prohibitions, restrictions, permits or other relevant information. The Customs and Border Protection officer who is entering the information on your behalf will not know if you will be asked any lodgement questions.
You are required to answer these questions. This can
be done at the Customs and Border Protection counter when you present the document if it is convenient at the time for both you and the officer. If you are not able to complete the responses at the counter you must complete them at a later time and return them to Customs and Border Protection before your declaration can be entered into the ICS.
The onus is on you, the owner, to contact Customs
and Border Protection to confirm the status of your declaration.
If you are required to answer further questions, Customs
and Border Protection may fax, email or post them to you, or you may collect them from a Customs and Border Protection counter. You are required to provide your responses to lodgement questions in writing – verbal answers cannot be accepted.If you have a restricted item, you will be requested to produce the permit/letter of authority before you can receive your Authority to Deal (ATD) (effectively your release notice).
If Customs and Border Protection require further
information about your goods in addition to the information required in the lodgement questions, we will contact you using the details you have provided on the declaration.
9.1 Sample lodgement questions
The lodgement questions referred to above are usually in relation to the goods description or tariff classification specified on your import declaration.
Lodgement questions are raised when Customs
and Border Protection require further information or clarification to ensure goods are properly declared.
Below are a few examples of questions that may be
asked.
• Do these goods contain knives that are daggers or
goods incorporating a concealed blade or flick knives and the like?
• Do these goods contain CITES-listed species?
• Do any of these goods contain objectionable material as described by Regulation 4A of the Customs (prohibited imports) Regulations?
• Does the importer have a licence to import ozone depleting substances as required under Regulation 5K of the Customs (prohibited imports) Regulations?
• Do these goods contain arsenic, cadmium or lead at levels in excess of those prescribed by the Hazardous Waste (regulations of exports and imports) Act?9 Lodgement questions

32 Documentary Import Declaration Comprehensive GuideCustoms and Border Protection and DAFF Biosecurity
conduct checks on imported goods to ensure the protection of Australian borders. There are several steps that need to be finalised before you are able to take delivery of your goods (see figure 21). Customs and Border Protection require you to provide enough information to assess your goods. The commercial documentation you have that relates to your goods (e.g. ocean bill of lading, master air waybill and packing lists) should be referred to when completing your declaration. You will need to present those documents to Customs and Border Protection if requested to do so.Once the imported goods reach their destination port they enter Customs control.
Goods will be released (through an ATD) when Customs
and Border Protection are satisfied the goods were properly reported and declared; permits are produced; duty, GST/and or LCT and other liabilities are paid; and DAFF Biosecurity concerns are addressed.
The ATD is your advice that the goods are available to
you (known as ‘delivery into home consumption’). 10 Process and clearance of goods
